On 28 September 1809 he married Elizabeth Cole Shipley( d.1828), daughter of Major- General Sir Charles Shipley. They had one child, David Stuart Erskine, 13th Earl of Buchan( 1815–1898). In 1833 he was living at 47 Minto Street in southern Edinburgh.\n","James Erskine, 6th Earl of BuchanJames Erskine, 6th Earl of Buchan( died 1640), was the eldest son of John Erskine, Earl of Mar, by his second wife, Marie Stewart, daughter of Esme Stewart, Duke of Lennox. He married Mary Douglas, 6th Countess of Buchan, daughter and heiress of James Douglas, 5th Earl of Buchan, and assumed the title of Earl of Buchan. This title was confirmed by a royal charter, dated 22 March 1617, the countess resigning her rights in his favour, and he was allowed the possession and exercise of all honours, dignities, and precedence of former earls of Buchan. A decree of the court of sessions, 25 July 1628, restored to Buchan and his wife the precedency over the earls of Eglinton, Montrose, Cassilis, Caithness, and Glencairn, which had been claimed by them, and granted by a former decree in 1606. On the accession of Charles I, Buchan became one of the lords of the bedchamber. He lived chiefly in London, where he died in 1640. He was buried at Auchterhouse, Forfarshire. His wife died before him in 1628. They left six children, two sons, James, who succeeded to the title, and John, and four daughters.\n","Alexander Stewart, Earl of BuchanAlexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, Alasdair Mór mac an Rígh, and called the Wolf of Badenoch (1343 – 20 June 1405), was the third surviving son of King Robert II of Scotland and youngest by his first wife, Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan. He was the first Earl of Buchan since John Comyn, from 1382 until his death. Alexander married the widowed Euphemia I, Countess of Ross, but they had no children. He did have a large family by his longtime mistress, Mairead inghean Eachainn. Alexander was Justiciar of Scotia for a time, but not an effective one. He held large territories in the north of Scotland before eventually losing a large part of them. Alexander is remembered for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its cathedral. His nickname was earned due to his notorious cruelty and rapacity, but there is no proof that it was used during his lifetime.\n","Jardine ComynJardine Comyn, Lord of Inverallochy, also known as Jordan, was a son of William Comyn, Lord of Badenoch later the Earl of Buchan and was granted the lands of Inverallochy from his father upon William becoming the Earl of Buchan, jure uxoris of his second wife Margaret, Countess of Buchan.\n","Alice Comyn, Countess of BuchanAlice Comyn, Countess of Buchan, Lady Beaumont( 1289 – 3 July 1349) was a Scottish noblewoman, a member of the powerful Comyn family which supported the Balliols, claimants to the disputed Scottish throne against their rivals, the Bruces. She was the niece of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, to whom she was also heiress, and after his death the Earldom of Buchan was successfully claimed by her husband Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, by right of his wife. His long struggle to claim her Earldom of Buchan was one of the causes of the Second War of Scottish Independence. Alice was the maternal grandmother of Blanche of Lancaster, and thus great- grandmother of King Henry IV of England.\n","Robert II of ScotlandRobert II (2 March 1316 – 19 April 1390) reigned as King of Scots from 1371 to his death as the first monarch of the House of Stewart. He was the son of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and of Marjorie Bruce, daughter of the Scottish king Robert the Bruce by his first wife Isabella of Mar. Edward Bruce, younger brother of Robert the Bruce, was named heir presumptive but died without heirs on 3 December 1318. Marjorie had died probably in 1317 in a riding accident and parliament decreed her infant son, Robert Stewart, as heir presumptive, but this lapsed on 5 March 1324 on the birth of a son, David, to King Robert and his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh. Robert Stewart became High Steward of Scotland on his father's death on 9 April 1326, and in the same year parliament confirmed the young Steward as heir should Prince David die without a successor. In 1329 King Robert I died and the six-year-old David succeeded to the throne under the guardianship of Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray. Edward Balliol, son of King John Balliol—assisted by the English and those Scottish nobles who had been disinherited by Robert I—invaded Scotland inflicting heavy defeats on the Bruce party on 11 August 1332 at Dupplin Moor and Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. Robert, who had fought at Halidon joined his uncle, King David in refuge in Dumbarton Castle. David escaped to France in 1334 and parliament, still functioning, appointed Robert and John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray as joint Guardians of the kingdom. Randolph was captured by the English in July 1335 and in the same year Robert submitted to Balliol bringing about the removal of his guardianship. The office was reinstated in 1338 and Robert held it until David's return from France in June 1341. Hostilities continued and Robert was with David at the Neville's Cross on 17 October 1346 and either escaped or fled the field but David was captured and remained a prisoner until he was ransomed in October 1357. Robert married Elizabeth Mure around 1348, legitimising his four sons and five daughters. His subsequent marriage to Euphemia de Ross in 1355 produced two sons and two surviving daughters. Robert rebelled against the King in 1363 but submitted to him following a threat to his right of succession. David died in 1371 and Robert succeeded him at the age of fifty-five. The border magnates continued to attack English-held zones in southern Scotland and by 1384, the Scots had re-taken most of the occupied lands. Robert ensured that Scotland was included in the Anglo-French truce of 1384 and that was a factor in the coup in November when he lost control of the country first to his eldest son, John, and then from 1388 to John's younger brother, Robert. King Robert died in Dundonald Castle in 1390 and was buried at Scone Abbey.\n","Mairead inghean EachainnMairead inghean Eachainn, also known as Mairead nic Eachainn, was a consort of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan( a man also known as the\" Wolf of Badenoch\"). She was the daughter of a man named Eachann, and probably the mother of several children, including Alexander's like- named son, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar.\n","John de InnesJohn de Innes( c. 1370 – 1414) was medieval Scottish churchman. Born probably in Moray, he went to France in his youth, receiving a bachelorate in civil law from the University of Paris by 1396 and in canon law by 1407. His education was partly paid for by the prebend of Duffus and a grant from Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray, taken by Bur from the judicial profits of his diocese. During Innes' study period, he was also pursuing an ecclesiastical career, being Archdeacon of Caithness from 1396 until 1398, and Dean of Ross, from some point between 1396 and 1398 until 1407. He gave up the latter position in that year, having been elected as Bishop of Moray sometime in late 1406, and receiving consecration from Pope Benedict XIII in either Italy or southern France in the following January. Innes was bishop for over seven years, and died at Elgin on 2 August 1414. Innes has been traditionally credited with supervising much of the rebuilding to Elgin Cathedral. The historian David Ditchburn believes Innes was an ally, and possibly even a client, of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, and perhaps his father Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, the latter of whom was the warlord responsible for burning down Elgin Cathedral during the episcopate of Alexander Bur.\n","Alexander Comyn, Earl of BuchanAlexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan( died 1289) was a Scoto- Norman magnate who was one of the most important figures in the 13th century Kingdom of Scotland. He was the son of William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan, and Marjory, Countess of Buchan, the heiress of the last native Scottish Mormaer of Buchan, Fergus. He was the chief counsellor of Alexander III, King of Scots for the entire period of the king's majority and, as Scotland's leading magnate, played a key role in safeguarding the independence of the Scottish monarchy. During his long career, Alexander Comyn was Justiciar of Scotia( 1258 – 89), Constable of Scotland( 1275 – 89), Sheriff of Wigtown( 1263 – 66), Sheriff of Dingwall( 1264 – 66), Ballie of Inverie( in Knoydart) and finally, Guardian of Scotland( 1286 – 89) during the first interregnum following the death of Alexander III. In 1284 he joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret of Norway as the heiress to King Alexander. He died sometime after 10 July 1289. Alexander had at least nine children with his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester:\n","Robert de Moravia, 6th Earl of SutherlandRobert de Moravia( also known as Robert Sutherland)( born about 1347 Dunrobin Castle, Scotland)( d.1427) was the 6th Earl of Sutherland and chief of Clan Sutherland.

They left six children, two sons, James, who succeeded to the title, and John, and four daughters.\n","Alexander Stewart, Earl of BuchanAlexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, Alasdair Mór mac an Rígh, and called the Wolf of Badenoch (1343 – 20 June 1405), was the third surviving son of King Robert II of Scotland and youngest by his first wife, Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan. He was the first Earl of Buchan since John Comyn, from 1382 until his death. Alexander married the widowed Euphemia I, Countess of Ross, but they had no children. He did have a large family by his longtime mistress, Mairead inghean Eachainn. Alexander was Justiciar of Scotia for a time, but not an effective one. He held large territories in the north of Scotland before eventually losing a large part of them. Alexander is remembered for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its cathedral. His nickname was earned due to his notorious cruelty and rapacity, but there is no proof that it was used during his lifetime.\n","Jardine ComynJardine Comyn, Lord of Inverallochy, also known as Jordan, was a son of William Comyn, Lord of Badenoch later the Earl of Buchan and was granted the lands of Inverallochy from his father upon William becoming the Earl of Buchan, jure uxoris of his second wife Margaret, Countess of Buchan.\n","Alice Comyn, Countess of BuchanAlice Comyn, Countess of Buchan, Lady Beaumont( 1289 – 3 July 1349) was a Scottish noblewoman, a member of the powerful Comyn family which supported the Balliols, claimants to the disputed Scottish throne against their rivals, the Bruces. She was the niece of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, to whom she was also heiress, and after his death the Earldom of Buchan was successfully claimed by her husband Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, by right of his wife. His long struggle to claim her Earldom of Buchan was one of the causes of the Second War of Scottish Independence. Alice was the maternal grandmother of Blanche of Lancaster, and thus great- grandmother of King Henry IV of England.\n","Robert II of ScotlandRobert II (2 March 1316 – 19 April 1390) reigned as King of Scots from 1371 to his death as the first monarch of the House of Stewart. He was the son of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and of Marjorie Bruce, daughter of the Scottish king Robert the Bruce by his first wife Isabella of Mar. Edward Bruce, younger brother of Robert the Bruce, was named heir presumptive but died without heirs on the way to the throne. Robert II was the first monarch of the House of Stewart and the founder of the Stewart dynasty. He reigned until his death in 1390, when he was succeeded by his son James I of Scotland.\n","John Comyn, 6th Earl of BuchanJohn Comyn, 6th Earl of Buchan( died 1640), was the eldest son of William Comyn, Lord of Badenoch later the Earl of Buchan and was granted the lands of Inverallochy from his father upon William becoming the Earl of Buchan, jure uxoris of his second wife Margaret, Countess of Buchan. He married Mary Douglas, 6th Countess of Buchan, daughter and heiress of James Douglas, 5th Earl of Buchan, and assumed the title of Earl of Buchan. This title was confirmed by a royal charter, dated 22 March 1617, the countess resigning her rights in his favour, and he was allowed the possession and exercise of all honours, dignities, and precedence of former earls of Buchan. A decree of the court of sessions, 25 July 1628, restored to Buchan and his wife the precedency over the ear\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[93mCorrect answer:\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[95m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[91mCorrect: False\u001b[0m\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.
