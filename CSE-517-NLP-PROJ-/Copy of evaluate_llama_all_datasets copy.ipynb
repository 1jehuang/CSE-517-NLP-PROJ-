Formed in late 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement Moyet placed in a UK music magazine, over the next 18 months the duo made two critically acclaimed albums, \"Upstairs at Eric's\" and \"You and Me Both\", blending Clarke's synthesizer melodies with Moyet's blues- and soul-influenced vocals.  Yazoo enjoyed worldwide success, particularly in their home country where three of their four singles reached the top three of the UK Singles Chart and both their albums made the top two of the albums chart.  In North America they are best known for the song \"Situation\", originally only a B-side in the UK but which was a club and airplay hit in the US and Canada before being released as the band's debut single in North America.\n",

Formed in late 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement Moyet placed in a UK music magazine, over the next 18 months the duo made two critically acclaimed albums, \"Upstairs at Eric's\" and \"You and Me Both\", blending Clarke's synthesizer melodies with Moyet's blues- and soul-influenced vocals.  Yazoo enjoyed worldwide success, particularly in their home country where three of their four singles reached the top three of the UK Singles Chart and both their albums made the top two of the albums chart.  In North America they are best known for the song \"Situation\", originally only a B-side in the UK but which was a club and airplay hit in the US and Canada before being released as the band's debut single in North America.\n",
